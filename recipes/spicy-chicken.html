    <h4>A spicy tangy chicken dish!</h4>
    <h3>You need these things!</h3>

        <li>Â½ cup Mexican-style hot sauce (such as Valentina)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar, or more to taste</li>
        <li>4 chicken thighs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Now do this!</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a small baking dish.</li>
        <li>Mix the hot sauce, paprika, ground cayenne pepper, and brown sugar in a bowl, and stir until the mixture is well combined. Place the chicken thighs in the baking dish, and coat them with a layer of sauce. Cover the dish with foil</li>
