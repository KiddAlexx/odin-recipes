    <h4>This is the world's hottest curry, because it contains the world's hottest chile, the Bhut Jolokia or 'Ghost Chile', which is three times hotter than a habanero. This pan-Asian dish is not for the faint of heart. It is atomically spicy! Enjoy!</h4>

    <h3>Grab the following!</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 tomatoes, diced</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>10 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato puree</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>3 ghost chile peppers, stemmed and coarsely chopped (use gloves)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chili powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground fenugreek</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 pounds cubed lamb</li>
        <li>¼ cup clarified butter (ghee)</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Now make it!</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place tomatoes, water, garlic, ginger, tomato puree, salt, ghost peppers, chili powder, garam masala, cumin, coriander, fenugreek, and black pepper into a blender and pulse several times to chop. Blend the ingredients until liquefied. Be careful, ghost chilies will burn eyes, mouth, or nose if touched.</li>
        <li>Pour the blended mixture into a large bowl and stir in lamb to coat; let lamb marinate at least 1 hour in refrigerator.</li>
        <li>Heat clarified butter in a large pan over medium-high heat and cook onion until lightly golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes, stirring constantly. Pour the lamb and marinade into the skillet and bring to a boil; cook and stir until sauce begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and simmer until lamb is tender, about 20 more minutes. Garnish with cilantro to serve.</li>
    </ol>
